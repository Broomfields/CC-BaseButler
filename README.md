# Winston

A Modded-Minecraft Automation Assistant built in 'Computer Craft'/'CC: Tweaked' and 'Advanced Peripherals'.


## To Do

* Isolate program to work from a core disk
* Actively store all screen text to a file
* Base rendering from said file - acting as a doubled buffer - will allow for future scrolling
* Implement spatially-aware rendering (in regards to text lines, and text wrapping)
* Better I/O handling - wish to be bale to run without a screen and without a chatbox
* Implement configuration files
* Implement assistant's programs/actions parsing with the ability for actions and to modularly store and access these on seperate disks (e.g. a disk for working with Mekanism).
